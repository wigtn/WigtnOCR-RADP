## 3 Arithmetic Reasoning

We begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic reasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where language models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia). Strikingly, chain-of-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with task-specific finetuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging GSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).

### 3.1 Experimental Setup

We explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.

**Benchmarks.** We consider the following five math word problem benchmarks: (1) the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2) the SVAMP dataset of math word problems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3) the ASDiv dataset of diverse math word problems (Miao et al., 2020), (4) the AQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5) the MAWPS benchmark (Konceł-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.

**Standard prompting.** For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by Brown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input–output pairs before outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and answers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).

**Chain-of-thought prompting.** Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot prompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most of the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars with chains of thought for prompting—Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the full set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20. (These particular exemplars did not undergo prompt engineering; robustness is studied in Section 3.4 and Appendix A.2.) To investigate whether chain-of-thought prompting in this form can successfully elicit successful reasoning across a range of
